The resources for this vary across different platforms. I used explored various methods of populating an empty array where the user-selected criteria would fit, but ultimately landed on concatenation as the methodology. A few resources for implementing and concatenating arrays were [Javascript Plain English][2], [W3 Schools][3], and [Stack Overflow][5].

Some other things I had referenced, were different methods of utilizing a copy button so that the end-user may grab the password and copy to their clipboard for further use elsewhere. The references used are for this, and other concepts such as for loops - were places like [W3 Schools][1], [Youtube][4], [Stack Overflow][6], [MDN][7], [Code Grepper][8], [Dev To][9], and [Codepen][10].
