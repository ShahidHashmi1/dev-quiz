## Description
Here is a looped quiz application. The user is on a clock to complete the quiz, and every wrong answer decreases their time. Once the timer interval reaches zero, the quiz ends. All data is stored to localstorage and retrieved to view high scores. Can easily be scaled and changed to meet other criteria.
